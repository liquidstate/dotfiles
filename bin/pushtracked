## Ignore any files not explicitly in our repositories so that `git status` is clean

## the first time you do it vcsh generates and include list based on what is currently
## tracked by git.  One you create the ignore file and add it to the repo (note use of
## -f to add in spite of it being on  the ignore list at first),  you need to generate
## the list again  so that it adds the  ignore list (now itself tracked by git) to the
## list of  not-ignored files.  Finally  you add the  revised  version  to  git before
## actually committing.
